The beginnings of a bastion module for GCP, now with compute firewall options.
The Bastion is designed to work primarily with a private Kubernetes Cluster and is enabled for OS Logins. You'll need to add the service role an OS role to your users they will be able to SSH into it.
Basic Kubernetes tools are also installed into the bastion by **default**.

2 examples are included, one with and one without a static IP.

## Usage

Add **module.bastion.tf** to your code:-

```terraform
module "bastion" {
  source             = "JamesWoolfenden/bastion/gcp"
  version            = "0.1.13"
  image              = var.image
  name               = var.name
  network_interface  = var.network_interface
  project            = var.project
  service_email      = var.service_email
  source_cidrs       = var.source_cidrs
  zone               = var.zone
}
```
